First lab assignment.
Detailed explanation on how the utr_lab1.py (automata with epsilon transitions) code works.

### AUTOMATA FUNCTIONALITY DESCRIPTION BELOW ###

Program reads automata definition from standard input.

Definition is given is such fashion:

  -In first line input strings are given and split by "|", ex. a,b,c|b,d,e|f,g,h|t,r,w
  
  -In second line all the possible states are split by ",", ex. s1,s2,s3,s4,s5
  
  -In third line all the possible symbols the automata works with are split by ",", ex. a,b,c,d,e,f,g
  
  -in fourth line acceptable states are split by ",", ex. s4, s5
  
  -In fifth line the starting state is given, ex. s1
  
  -In sixth and all the other lines transition functions are given like following: s1,a->s2
                                                                                   s2,b->s3
                                                                                   s3,c->s4
                                                                                   
                                                                                   
After the automata definition is given, the program will write out which states automata was in for every symbol in given input string, ex:


01 s1|s2,s3|s4,s5

02 s3|s2,s4|s3

03 s4|s1|s2,s3,s5


States will be printed in alphabetical order.

Epsilon transition is coded by symbol "$".

If there are no next states for given current states in given transition, next states (empty states) are coded by symbol "#".

### SIMPLE EXAMPLE ON HOW AUTOMATA WILL WORK FOR GIVEN INPUT ###

Given input:

a,pnp,a|pnp,lab2|pnp,a|pnp,lab2,utr,utr

p5,s3,s4,st6,s1,s2

a,lab2,pnp,utr

p5

s1

s3,a->s2

s3,lab2->p5,s4

s4,$->st6

s4,utr->p5,s3

s1,a->stanje2

s1,pnp->s3

s2,$->st6

s2,a->#


Result:

01 s1|st6,s2|#|#

02 s1|s3|p5,s4,st6

03 s1|s3|st6,s2

04 s1|s3|p5,s4,st6|p5,s3|#
